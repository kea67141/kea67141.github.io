I attended High school at Holy Innocents' Episcopal School in Atlanta, Georgia. I was an Alpha Omega there, meaning that I attended the entire way through. I began 
Holy Innocents' my Pre-K year and I graduated in 2016. I am very thankful for that learning enviroment, the teachers were incredibly skillful and I was surrounded by 
people that were incredibly hard working. I met some of my best friends there, those who are featured in our graduation photo. On the far left is Johnna, she was 
new freshman year and we became very close almost immediately. Next to her is Kendall, she came in 5th grade from Kansas but I didn't become friends with her until
high school. Between Kendall and I is Kasey. Kasey also came freshman year and is one of my very close friends.

The education I recieved at Holy Innocents' helped give me the skills to be successful in the future. I took several AP classes in my time there as well as 
being active in many clubs and honor societies. I think the college workload would have been a lot harder of an adjustment had I not had a hard workload in highschool also. 
I am thankful that I took hard classes then so it was not shocking when I got here.
