I now attend the University of Georgia in Athens. I am a Marketing Major applying to the Terry College of Business in the spring and I also have a Communications Minor. 
I lived in Russell Hall last year and I had a wonderful freshman year. I noticed immediately how every teacher here truely loves what they teach and I think that is really cool.
I have had the opportunity to learn so much here of which I am so greatful. I have really taken an interest in my communications and economic classes especially. College is 
allot more work then highschool but I am managing to handle it. One of my favorite places to study is that cool room thats hidden away in the Library.
</p>
<p> 
I also have met a ton of absolutely wonderful people in my time here at college. My hallmates last year ended up becoming some of my best friends. I am still friends with
the girls I hung out with at orientation, almost a year and a half ago now also. I am a member of Greek Life through Kappa Alpha Theta and I do have many friends through that
but I also have a lot of friends in other sororities and non-Greek life too. It is fun this year to live with all my theta friends in the house. I feel as if I have become a lot closer
with them. The food is also much better this year then last. Our cook Jen is fantastic. I am glad to have my time with Bolton over with. </p>
