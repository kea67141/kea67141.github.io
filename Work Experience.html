Through these jobs I have gained all the experience I have today. I gained confidence through my first job as a hostess at Buttermilk Kitchen. I have since 
worked in telemarketing, as a sales representitive and in my current jobs as both holding a position on UGA HERO's one of UGA's "Big Three" philanthropies and as an 
intern for Croozen. Many of my jobs have been sale based. I gained my first experience in this through cold calling for N2 Publishing selling advertisement space.
It was a commision based job and the first time I ever pitched a sale. Working as a Sales Representative for Macy's in Lenox I worked in both commission and non-commission
based sales. I had to gain product knowledge and become quite fimilar with inventory procedures. While UGA Hero's is not technically sale-based, it is a philanthropy
in which fundraising is a main component. Within Croozen I work with advertising on campus as well as working to initiate rides or "sales" in the case of the app.

Other then increasing sales experience my jobs also were important in teaching me respect. Working as both a telemarketer and as a hostess in the food industry I saw 
many people treat the workers with disrespect. I cannot tell you how many times I called and was cursed at as a telemarketer, or how many people ordered an expensive meal and
tippped less than 20%. After working these jobs I vowed to always tip at least 20% and to never rudely answer an unknown call. I think it is really important that everyone has
experience in these fields. Everyone I ever worked with was incredibly hard working and no one ever deserves to be disrespected.
