This is my family! This photo is taken at my brother's graduation. My brother's name is Jimmy and we are one year apart. He attended Holy Innocents' also. He now
currently is a student at Texas A&M studying engineering. I am thankful he is out of state because I now have his car. Jimmy likes music, video games, and working out. 
My dad works for TelAuthority. He is an entreprenuer and created his own business after working for AT&T and Bellsouth. He is orginally from New York, though he went to
college in Missouri and in Austin Texas. My mother used to do lab work at Emory but she now has a very bad neck and cannot do that anymore. She has had several surgeries and is
still in a lot of pain but is on the track to getting better. She is from Tenneesee and went to the gross University of Tennessee. It was really great when we beat them in 
football this year.

I love my family very much. I talk to my parents quite often. My mother and I talk almost everyday. My dad and I talk every week. My brother and I keep up a little less,
but he is a very busy Freshman in college trying to figure out his way around.

<p>
Many people say that I am very much like my parents. I have created a table of what I got from whom.
