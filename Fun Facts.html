My first fun fact is that I hate fruit! I really hate it it is more of a fear then a dislike. Honestly I wasn't too happy looking at photos of it to put on here, but I 
wasn't sure what else to include a photo of. Yes, I don't like any fruit. No, I do not like any fruit juices. No, I don't like fruit flavored candy. No, I am not a fan of 
perfumes and soaps that smell like fruit. I actually have a scale of how much I dislike fruit. I will present it in the table below. The bottom of the list is the least bad fruit, the top of
the list gets worse.

Another fun fact is that my Appendix ruptured inside of me when I was 11. I almost died but they figured out what had happened just in time. I went to school that day because I felt
better, and when the doctor called to check in and my mom told him that he called me in to the hospital immediately. It turns out if you go from really bad to fine in a short period it 
is very likely the euphoria before you die. He was right it had ruptured that morning. Now it is a cool story to tell.

Another fun fact is that I am missing nine teeth. I have a very small mouth and only three molars. I did have one wisdom tooth though, just one. They say it is a generational thing
that because of the differences in the minerals in the water and the the difference in how  food is processed that new generations will be missing the same teeth as me. I was one of the
first of the generation to be missing them but it has become really common in age groups younger then me.

My last fun fact is that I dye my hair. This is the least fun of my fun facts and I appologize. I am naturally a dark brunette but I dye my hair blonde. I started my Sophmore year of highschool
and like the look and have kept it up.
