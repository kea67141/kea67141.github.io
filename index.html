Welcome to my webpage! Here you will be able to learn a little about me! My full name is Kathryn Elyse Arnold though I go by Katie. 
I am from Atlanta, Georgia and I am 20 years old. I graduated from Holy Innocents' Episcopal School in 2016 and I currently attend the University of 
Georgia in Athens with plans to graduate in 2020. I am a Marketing Major with a Minor in Communication studies.I am a dedicated and hard worker and
am excited to have the oppertunity to tell you a little about myself.
</p>
<p>
My school time internship with a start up app named Croozen
allowed me a better view into the operations and marketing of a company. I began as the UGA Marketing intern, with a job description of marketing the long 
distance ride share app to the college population. Within two months I was promoted to <u>Southeast Corporate Management Intern</u> where I began to see 
the true progress of improvement within the company. I am able to suggest ideas actually integrated into their business model which is really cool. 
The idea I am most proud of is having drivers favorite locations, and allowing riders to suggest rides to be taken. If there are no rides currently
available for a location, the application will pull from the pool of drivers with a favorited location there and will offer them an incentive to take 
the ride. This idea of mine is currently being developed and will be included in the next software update.
</p>
<p>
Communication is also a subject of imporantance to me. While classes such as interpersonal communcations, public speaking and business professional
communications have given me knowledge into the subject, I have gained experience through various jobs in the workplace. In every job I have ever had,
communications was integral to my success. While through being both a hostess for Buttermilk Kitchen and as a sales representative for Macy's my communication 
was more customer service driven-For my current job communication is an integral factor in getting the product out there. From weekly phone conversations with
both the CEO and creator of the app, to pitching the product to groups of 300+ people each week, the communication skills I have learned are key.
