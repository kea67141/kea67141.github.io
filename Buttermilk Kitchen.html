One of my favorite places I have ever worked was Buttermilk Kitchen. Buttermilk kitchen is a popular breakfast joint in Atlanta, and has been
featured on many travel TV shows as a place worthy of your wait. This place does have quite a wait, indeed. As a hostess my entire senior of highschool, I can tell you that 
this place has on average a couple hour wait to get in to its doors. I know what what you are thinking, "How could it possibily be worth it to wait that long for food?!" and I 
can tell you it absolutely is worth it. I have created for you a table of usual wait times so you can plan your next visit!

One of their most sought after items are their buttermilk biscuts paired with their buttermilk battered chicken breasts. This is so popular they tend to sell out by 11 am, 
which is saying something. If you want to try this incredible biscuit I recommend you arrive early in the morning. Buttermilk Kitchen offers many options however, and everything is wonderful.
The head chef won a cooking show and her prize was her very own restraunt. She is incredible. She has a daily new dish often, and those that are popular stick around. 
I 100% recommend travelling to Buttermilk Kitchen at some point. <strong>I have never had such a good breakfast.</strong>

Buttermilk Kitchen is also a great place to work. I worked there for two summers as a hostess and occasionally picked up shifts as a busser. During the school year I worked on weekends
in order to make some extra spending money. It was great to work here because they close so early in the day and I was still able to see my friends and complete my homework while having
this job. The staff is friendly and even now they always welcome me back when I visit.
