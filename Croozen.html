My current internship is with Croozen. Croozen is a start up app for long distance rideshare. Basically what it does is it connects
riders to drivers already traveling to a certain location. Say I am headed to Atlanta for the weekend, I could "sell" the seats in my car
for a suggested price of $16 a seat and if I sell 4 seats I will make over $60 for travelling to a location I was already headed to!
</p>
<p>
Croozen is also super safe! Sign in with your uga.edu and you will only be connected to other college students. They also do background checks in order to compelete 
your profile and women-only ride options are available! Also probably the best thing about it...IT'S FREE! <strong>So go ahead and download it today or check out their website for more details!</strong>

I really enjoy working for Croozen because I think it is a product with a real need. I have been doing long distance with my boyfriend for a year and a half now, and I 
can't emphasize how much how much I wished this was a thing my freshman year. I spent countless dollars on plane tickets and there was many times I had to miss out on date
nights or formals because I didn't have the financial funds to get there. This year I am lucky enough to have a car, but it is still useful for me because now I can make 
money driving to go see him. Talk about having a job doing what you love! This product is easy to market to people, so many people are looking for a cheaper long distance rideshare
option or to make some money traveling.
</p>
<p>
Through this job I also gained experience in marketing and management. I began as UGA's marketing intern and was soon promoted to the Southeast Corporate Management intern. 
I enjoy pitching this product to people and I am very invested in its success. I have weekly calls with the CEO and I help by making suggestions to improve the app. I've gained
allot of experience through working for Croozen, I love my job and I hope it is one I can keep all of college. It is a wonderful product and I highly suggest you check it out.
